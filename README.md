===========================

I incorporated my 'Build a Pendant' app (coded in jquery) into the framework from p2. Basically a user can go on to the web site and type a word onto a pendant and purchase it. I updated my jquery to send details to paypal in the purchasing process. There is also a link to a view the contents of the shopping cart.



I added ecommerce capability with functioning paypal buy button and shopping cart. 

Added jquery plugin to validate empty fields and valid email in 'signup', validate email and check for empty fields in 'login'.

I changed the html in the 'edit profile' to populate the website, if they entered one, and to validate the url. Ok, so it is a good idea to populate the web url â€¦ I was wrong. Also, validating the url allows a user to click the active link in the 'follow', 'unfollow' column.

I used the ajax plugin to let the user know their post has been added without leaving the page.
